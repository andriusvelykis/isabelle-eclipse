## Description

Isabelle/Eclipse started as a port of Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE to integrate with Eclipse IDE as plug-ins. The integration uses common Eclipse components to provide theory editing, correct symbols, completion assistance, prover output and other features. By building on Eclipse it inherits various IDE goodies out of the box.
