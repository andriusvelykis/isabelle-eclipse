# Go to definition

The definitions of most elements in the proof script and proof output (e.g. data types, operators, lemmas, proof commands, etc.) can be accessed via these selections:

-   **Ctrl + click** via the hyperlink (**Cmd + click** on Mac OS X). Note that you may need to move the mouse and hover over the definition while pressing Ctrl (Cmd) for the hyperlink to appear.

-   **Navigate > Open Definition** in the menu, while the cursor is placed on the element (editor only for now).
-   **F3** keyboard shortcut - same as the menu option above.

The hyperlinks are supported both in Isabelle editor and _Prover Output_ view.

When selected, the definition of target element will be opened and selected in the editor.

_Note that definitions in Isabelle ML files may be opened in an external editor if no ML editor is available within Eclipse._
